Microlensing Planet Discoveries - Yossi

2003 first microlensing planet

OGLE/MOA

3rd low mass 

neptune like planets common

microlensing often involve M stars

OGLE and MOA both southern sky

archival data

JP Beaulieu - Tasmania, I A de Paris

High-Resolution followup of microlensing

- lens flux sans source/lense reolve

- with lens source resolve

free floating planet

papers

H band source flux

Daisuke Suzuki

Mass Function fo Planets Measured from Microlensing


planet discovery vs snow line

Takahiro Sumi - Free-floating planet

not orbitting any host stars

in young star forming regions, hot emitting infrared radiation

Size between T dwarf and jupiter

CCD makes observation possible of lensing

microlensing not rely on flux from host star

MOA

1.8 m, 80 M pix
2.2 deg^2 FOV

observing towards the galatic bulge

need high cadence

Observed Distribution of Planets

 - inferences form microlensings, rv, direct imaign

3279 planets

microlensing observables

M Dwarfs

CPS
HARPS

RV survey limits

future work

new results mass ratio
